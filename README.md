🛠️ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

XAMPP: Local server for testing (Download).
VSCode: Code editor with extensions (Download).
Recommended: Live Server, Prettier, GitLens, SynthWave ’84.


Git: Version control (Download).
Browser: Chrome/Firefox for DevTools debugging.

Folder Structure
JavaScript-Projects/
AJAX/
ajax_basic.html  # Main webpage with AJAX logic
content.html     # Primary content payload
content2.html    # Secondary content payload
style.css        # Neon-cyber styling
C:\xampp\htdocs\
AJAX/               # Mirrored for XAMPP testing

Step-by-Step Setup

Install XAMPP:

Download and install for your system (Windows, Mac, or Mac M1).
Start Apache in the XAMPP Control Panel.


Set Up VSCode:

Install VSCode and recommended extensions.
Open the JavaScript-Projects folder.


Create the Project:

Inside JavaScript-Projects, create an AJAX folder.
Add ajax_basic.html, content.html, content2.html, and style.css (code provided in the repository).
Copy the AJAX folder to C:\xampp\htdocs\AJAX for local testing.


Initialize Git:
cd JavaScript-Projects
git init
git config --global user.name "GatusSecGG"
git config --global user.email "gatussecgg@example.com"


Test the Webpage:

Start XAMPP’s Apache and visit http://localhost/AJAX/ajax_basic.html.
Alternatively, use VSCode’s Live Server for rapid previews.
Interact with buttons (Launch Payload, Switch Payload, Cyber Quiz, Reset Mission).
Debug with DevTools (F12) → Network/Console.


Push to GitHub:

Create a JavaScript-Projects repository on GitHub.
Stage, commit, and push:git add .
git commit -m "Launched GatusSecGG AJAX Infinity"
git remote add origin https://github.com/markjptolentino/AJAX.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main




Compare with Model Answer:

Download the model answer (link TBD) and verify functionality, comments, and styling.



🚀 Usage

Launch Payload: Fetches content securely via AJAX with a 3D terminal effect.
Switch Payload: Cycles between content.html and content2.html.
Cyber Quiz: Tests cybersecurity knowledge with randomized questions.
Reset Mission: Restarts the mission for replayability.
Firewall Log: Tracks AJAX requests in real-time.
Sound Effects: Sci-fi beeps enhance interactivity.

Pro Tip: Open DevTools to monitor AJAX requests and ensure no security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CORS issues).
🔒 Cybersecurity Highlights

Secure AJAX: Validates xhr.status and xhr.readyState to prevent injection attacks.
Error Handling: Displays cyber-themed alerts for failed requests.
XSS Prevention: Sanitizes content before DOM injection.
Mock Firewall: Simulates real-time security monitoring.
